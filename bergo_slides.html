		<h1>Problem Statment</h1>
		<p>The website redesign for Bergo Fencing Inc. was necessary largely due to the outdated look, excessive white space, and poor mobile usability of the original site. The goal was to create a modern, responsive design that better showcased the company's services, improved user experience, and encouraged customer inquiries. The project focused on redesigning key pages, optimizing layout and images, and ensuring mobile compatibility.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_role">
		<h1>My Role</h1>
		<p>This was a solo project where I was responsible for the entire redesign process from start to finish. I created wireframes, designed a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, and then programmed the fully responsive website based on that design. All design and development decisions were made independently.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_tech">
		<h1>Technology Used</h1>
		<p>The project utilized HTML and CSS for building and styling the website, providing full control over layout and responsiveness. Figma was used during the design phase to create wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype, allowing for clear visualization before development began. GitHub served as the version control and code repository platform, ensuring organized progress tracking and easy access to previous iterations.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_outcome">
		<h1>Results & Outcome</h1>
		<p>In the end, the project was successfully completed, and the goals were achieved. The website now features a modern, responsive design that effectively showcases the contractor's services and provides a much-improved user experience. One key lesson learned was the importance of planning for mobile-first design to ensure accessibility across all devices. Additionally, I gained valuable experience managing the entire project solo, from design through to development, which improved my skills in both areas.</p>
