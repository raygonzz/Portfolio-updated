		<h1>Problem Statment</h1>
		<p>The website redesign for Bergo Fencing Inc. was necessary largely due to the outdated look, excessive white space, and poor mobile usability of the original site. The goal was to create a modern, responsive design that better showcased the company's services, improved user experience, and encouraged customer inquiries. The project focused on redesigning key pages, optimizing layout and images, and ensuring mobile compatibility.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_role">
		<h1>My Role</h1>
		<p>This was a solo project where I was responsible for the entire redesign process from start to finish. I created wireframes, designed a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, and then programmed the fully responsive website based on that design. All design and development decisions were made independently.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_tech">
		<h1>Technology Used</h1>
		<p>The project utilized HTML and CSS for building and styling the website, providing full control over layout and responsiveness. Figma was used during the design phase to create wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype, allowing for clear visualization before development began. GitHub served as the version control and code repository platform, ensuring organized progress tracking and easy access to previous iterations.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="bergo_outcome">
		<h1>Results & Outcome</h1>
		<p>In the end, the project was successfully completed, and the goals were achieved. The website now features a modern, responsive design that effectively showcases the contractor's services and provides a much-improved user experience. One key lesson learned was the importance of planning for mobile-first design to ensure accessibility across all devices. Additionally, I gained valuable experience managing the entire project solo, from design through to development, which improved my skills in both areas.</p>
	</div>
        <div class="bergo_problem">
        <h1>Typography</h1>
        <p>This project uses a two-font system to create clear visual hierarchy and enhance readability. Noto Sans was selected for headers and emphasis text due to its clean, modern appearance and strong legibility, helping key elements stand out. For body text and longer paragraphs, Lexend Light was chosen for its soft, open letterforms, promoting a smoother reading experience and maintaining a clean, minimalist tone throughout the design.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="bergo_outcome">
        <h1>Color</h1>
        <p>For this project, I chose a bold and modern color palette to create visual impact and maintain strong contrast for accessibility. The primary red <span class="red">(#FF464A)</span> brings energy and draws attention to key interactive elements, while the deep gray <span class="gray">(#3D3D3D)</span> provides a sleek, neutral background that enhances readability and reduces eye strain. The crisp white <span class="white">(#FFFFFF)</span> ensures clarity and clean separation of content, reinforcing a minimalist and user-friendly aesthetic.
