    <h1>League of Legends | Zodiac Calendar</h1>
    <h2>Front-End Development Case Study</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a website which showcases 12 different Zodiac signs using different League of Legends characters.</p>

    <div class="league_problem">
        <h1>Problem Statment</h1>
        <p>The project was created to provide a fun, interactive way for users to discover which League of Legends champion aligns with their zodiac sign based on their birthday. There was no existing tool combining zodiac signs and LoL champions so this project aimed to fill that gap.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="league_role">
        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>This was a solo project where I handled everything from initial design to final deployment. I created wireframes and a prototype in Figma, then built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was responsible for both the design and development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="league_tech">
        <h1>Technology Used</h1>
        <p>The site was built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript to handle user input and zodiac logic. Figma was used for designing the interface, and all code was managed and versioned through GitHub. No additional frameworks or libraries were used.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="league_outcome">
        <h1>Results & Outcome</h1>
        <p>The final product successfully delivered an interactive tool that matched users to champions based on their birthday. It met its goals of combining entertainment with clean UI/UX. A key takeaway was how effective simple logic and intuitive design can be in creating engaging user experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="league_outcome">
        <h1>Typography</h1>
        <p>For this project, I used Beaufort, the same font family used in League of Legends. It helps keep the branding consistent and adds to the overall feel of the site. The bold and elegant style fits perfectly with the game's fantasy vibe and strategic tone, making the experience feel more connected and immersive.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="league_outcome">
        <h1>Color</h1>
        <p>The colors used in this project are pulled directly from League of Legends’ official palette to maintain brand authenticity and enhance immersion. Gold <span class="gold">(#C89B3C)</span> highlights key info, while muted tan <span class="tan">(#A09B8C)</span> keeps text readable with a fantasy feel. Dark navy <span class="navy">(#010A13)</span> sets a deep background tone.</p>
